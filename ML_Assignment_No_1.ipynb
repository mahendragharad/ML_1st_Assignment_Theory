It consists of a dataset where each example or data point is associated with a corresponding label or target. In other words, for each input data point, there is a known, correct output or classification provided. The purpose of a labeled training set is to train a machine learning model to learn the relationship between the input data and the desired output or prediction.\n",

        "**Generalization:** Model-based algorithms aim to create a model that can generalize well to new, unseen data. This means the model should capture the underlying patterns in the training data without memorizing it. Generalization helps the model make accurate predictions on data it hasn't encountered during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Accuracy:** The model should make accurate predictions or classifications on both the training data and new data. High accuracy is a key criterion for evaluating the success of a model-based learning algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Interpretability:** In some cases, it's important that the model is interpretable, meaning that its internal workings can be easily understood and explained. This is particularly important in domains like healthcare or finance, where decisions need to be justified and transparent.\n",

        "**Linear Regression:** This algorithm fits a linear model to predict a continuous target variable. It aims to find the best-fitting line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that minimizes the sum of squared differences between predicted and actual values.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Logistic Regression:** Used for binary classification problems, logistic regression fits a logistic curve to the data to model the probability of a binary outcome.\n",

        "ANS : If a machine learning model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize its results to new situations (i.e., it exhibits poor generalization), it indicates a common issue known as overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model learns to fit the training data too closely, capturing noise and specific details that do not apply to unseen data. To address this problem, here are three different options:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Regularization:**\n",
        "\n",
        "One common approach to combat overfitting is to apply regularization techniques, such as L1 (Lasso) or L2 (Ridge) regularization. These methods add a penalty term to the model's loss function that discourages overly complex model parameters.\n",

        "2. **More Data:**\n",
        "\n",
        "In some cases, overfitting can be mitigated by increasing the size of the training dataset. A larger and more diverse dataset can provide the model with a broader range of examples, making it harder to overfit.\n",
